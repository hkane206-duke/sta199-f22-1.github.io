# Harrison's sta199-f22-1.github.io Repo

This is the repo that I kept all of my projects working through Duke's Intro to Data Science Course. I didn't take this class, but have been working through this class on my own using publically available resources.

Source code for the course website for STA 199 - Section 1 taught by Dr. Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel in Fall 2022 at Duke University.
